# SKYJO Card Game Model

There are two models: a rule-based model written Scheme, and a machine learning model in Python.

In SKYJO, players start a round without knowing their cards or those of their opponents. As the round unfolds, players gain more information, but it remains imperfect, and a stochastic element remains until the end.
